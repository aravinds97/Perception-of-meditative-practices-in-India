# Abstract : 
Meditation offers a complex study and over the past few decades several research studies have demonstrated the effect of various meditative practices with respect to physiological as well as psychological changes. Through this study we would be analysing the effects of meditative practices in oneâ€™s life at a more fundamental level with respect to various well-being factors and would try to validate our findings to throw light on the beneficial effects of meditation. We would then suggest the limitations of this study and also present the future scope of work to be conducted to explore this subjective topic in a more optimal way.
